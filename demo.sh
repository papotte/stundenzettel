echo "üìÅ NEW FILES CREATED:"
echo "src/services/team-settings-service.ts"
echo "src/services/team-settings-service.firestore.ts"
echo "src/services/team-settings-service.local.ts"
echo "src/services/__tests__/team-settings-service.test.ts"
echo "TEAM_SETTINGS_IMPLEMENTATION.md"

echo "üîß MODIFIED FILES:"
echo "src/lib/types.ts - Added TeamSettings interface"

echo "üéØ HOW IT WORKS:"
echo ""
echo "For Team Administrators:"
echo "1. Navigate to Team Management ‚Üí Settings"
echo "2. Use new tabbed interface to configure:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Export format (Excel, PDF, or both)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Export fields (location, pause, driver time, etc.)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Default compensation percentages"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Override permissions for team members"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Company details for exports"
echo ""

echo "For Team Members:"
echo "1. Individual settings pages now respect team configuration"
echo "2. Team-controlled fields are disabled with explanatory messages"
echo "3. Settings inherit team defaults but can be overridden if permitted"
echo "4. Visual indicators show when settings come from team"

echo "üß™ TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Service layer follows existing patterns (Firestore + Local implementations)"
echo "‚Ä¢ getEffectiveUserSettings() merges team and user preferences"
echo "‚Ä¢ Override permissions control what users can customize"
echo "‚Ä¢ Backward compatible with existing user settings"
echo "‚Ä¢ Full type safety with TypeScript interfaces"
