# User Account Deletion Feature - GDPR Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the user account deletion feature implemented to ensure GDPR compliance and provide users with the ability to permanently delete their accounts and all associated data.

## Implementation Details

### Security Measures
- **Multi-Authentication Support**: Supports different authentication providers
  - **Password Users**: Must re-enter their current password to confirm deletion
  - **Google OAuth Users**: Must re-authenticate with Google popup to confirm deletion
  - **Other Providers**: Must enter their email address as fallback confirmation
- **Provider Detection**: Automatically detects user's authentication method using Firebase providerData
- **Multi-step Confirmation**: Clear warning dialog with explicit confirmation required
- **Secure Deletion**: All user data is permanently removed from the database

### Data Deletion Scope
The following data is permanently deleted when a user deletes their account:

#### Firestore Implementation
- User settings document (`/users/{userId}/settings/general`)
- All time entries collection (`/users/{userId}/timeEntries/`)
- User document itself (`/users/{userId}`)
- Firebase Authentication account

#### Local/Test Implementation
- Mock user data from localStorage
- User settings from localStorage
- Time entries from localStorage
- Any other user-related data in localStorage

### GDPR Compliance Features

#### âœ… Implemented
1. **Right to Erasure (Article 17)**: Complete data deletion functionality
2. **Clear Warning**: Users are informed that deletion is permanent and irreversible
3. **Authentication Requirement**: Password confirmation prevents accidental deletion
4. **Secure Processing**: Uses Firebase Auth re-authentication for security
5. **Comprehensive Deletion**: All user data is removed from all storage locations

#### ðŸ”„ TODO/Future Improvements
1. **Grace Period**: Consider implementing a 30-day grace period before permanent deletion
2. **Email Confirmation**: Send email notification when account is deleted
3. **Data Export**: Allow users to export their data before deletion (GDPR Article 20)
4. **Audit Logging**: Log account deletion events for compliance tracking
5. **Subscription Handling**: Cancel active subscriptions and handle billing

### Technical Implementation

#### Services
- `user-deletion-service.ts`: Main service interface with multiple authentication methods
- `user-deletion-service.firestore.ts`: Production Firestore implementation with Google OAuth support
- `user-deletion-service.local.ts`: Test/mock implementation for all authentication types

#### Authentication Methods
1. **Password Authentication** (`deleteUserAccount`)
   - For users who created accounts with email/password
   - Re-authenticates using EmailAuthProvider.credential()
   
2. **Google OAuth Authentication** (`deleteUserAccountWithGoogle`) 
   - For users who signed in with Google
   - Re-authenticates using GoogleAuthProvider and reauthenticateWithPopup()
   
3. **Email Fallback Authentication** (`deleteUserAccountWithEmail`)
   - For users with other authentication providers or as fallback
   - Validates email matches current user account

#### UI Components
- Updated security page with password confirmation dialog
- Clear warning messages and confirmation flow
- Loading states and error handling

#### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests for both service implementations
- UI tests for password confirmation flow
- Error handling test coverage

### Usage Instructions

1. **Access**: Navigate to Settings â†’ Security
2. **Initiate**: Click "Delete Account" button
3. **Confirm**: Read warning and enter current password
4. **Execute**: Click "Delete my account" to permanently delete

### Error Handling
- Invalid password: Shows specific error message
- Network errors: Generic error with retry option
- Authentication errors: Redirects to login if session expired

### Internationalization
Fully localized in English and German with appropriate warning messages and confirmation text.

### Security Considerations
- Re-authentication required before deletion
- HTTPS encryption for all data transmission
- Immediate session termination after deletion
- No data recovery possible after deletion

## Usage Instructions

### Account Deletion Flow

1. **Navigate** to Settings â†’ Security page
2. **Click** "Delete Account" button in the Danger Zone
3. **Read** the permanent deletion warning carefully
4. **Complete authentication** based on your sign-in method:

#### For Password Users
- Enter your current password in the confirmation field
- Click "Delete my account" to proceed

#### For Google OAuth Users  
- Click "Delete my account" to trigger Google re-authentication
- Complete the Google sign-in popup when prompted
- Account deletion proceeds after successful re-authentication

#### For Other Authentication Methods
- Enter your email address to confirm your identity
- Email must match your current account email
- Click "Delete my account" to proceed

5. **Immediate logout** and redirect to login page upon successful deletion

### Error Handling
- **Invalid password**: User prompted to try again
- **Email mismatch**: User notified of incorrect email
- **Google authentication cancelled**: Deletion cancelled, user can retry
- **Network errors**: User notified and can retry the operation

## Compliance Statement
This implementation satisfies GDPR requirements for user data deletion (Right to Erasure) while maintaining security best practices. The system ensures permanent and irreversible data deletion upon user request.
