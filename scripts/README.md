# Scripts Directory

This directory contains debugging and utility scripts for the Stripe integration. These are **development tools** for manual testing and debugging, not proper automated tests.

## ⚠️ Important Note

These scripts are designed to help you verify your Stripe integration during development. They are **not** part of your automated test suite. For proper testing, use:

- **Unit/Integration Tests**: `npm test` (Jest)
- **End-to-End Tests**: `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright)

- Verifying configuration changes

### During Deployment

- Verifying production Stripe setup
- Testing webhook endpoints
- Validating environment variables

### During Troubleshooting

- Isolating Stripe API issues
- Debugging webhook processing
- Validating data flow

## When NOT to Use These Scripts

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use proper automated tests instead
- **Production Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools and alerts
