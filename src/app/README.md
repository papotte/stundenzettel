# App Directory

This directory contains the core of the Next.js application, following the App Router structure.

- **`layout.tsx`**: The root layout for the entire application.
- **`globals.css`**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS definitions.
- **Sub-directories (e.g., `/login`, `/settings`)**: Each represents a route in the application, containing its own `page.tsx` file.
